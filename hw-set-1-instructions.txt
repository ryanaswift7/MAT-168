Problem 1:

Alice O. Hare works in an investment company on Wall Street. She is considering investing in four bounds, and $1 million dollar is available for the investment. The expected annual return, the worst-case annual return on each bond, and the “duration” of each bond are given in Table 1. The duration of a bond is a measure of the bond’s sensitivity to interest rates. Alice wants to maximize the expected return subject to the following three constraints.

    Constraint 1: The worst-case return of the bond portfolio must be at least 8%.
    Constraint 2: The average duration of the portfolio must be at most 6. For example, a portfolio that invested $600,000 in bond 1 and $400,000 in bond 4 have an average duration of (600,000*3+400,000*9)/1,000,000 = 5.4.
    Constraint 3: Because of diversification requirements, at most 42% of the total amount invested can be invested in a single bond.

 

                 Table 1

bond 	Expected return (%) 	Worst-case return (%) 	Duration

1 				13 						6 					3

2 				7 						7 					4

3 				12 						10 					7

4 				14 						9 					9

Problem 2

A small bioengineering consulting firm in Davis has 3 senior Rabbit Technology designers available to work on 4 current projects over the next 2 weeks. Each designer has 80 hours to split among the projects, and the following table shows the manager’s scoring (0=nil to 100=perfect) of the capability of each Rabbit Technology designer to contribute to each project, along with the estimate of the hours that each project will require.

 

 
	

				1 		2 		3 		4
		
		A 		90 		80 		10 		50
		
		B 		60 		70 		50 		65
		
		C 		70 		40 		75 		85

Required 		70		50 		85 		35

 

Formulate a linear optimization model to choose a work assignment that maximizes the total capability score.

(a) First write down the model constraint by constraint, using the given data.

(b) Then generalize the problem, introducing index sets for the designers and jobs, introducing general (algebraic) notation for the given parameters and the decision variables.

(c) Model and solve it using AMPL or CVXpy. Show relevant input/output.
