The programs for MAT 168 could either be written in AMPL or Python. Obviously, I chose Python because I'm a FOSS shill. So far, the only packages need to run all of the programs are CVXPY and NumPy. If using an environment management system like conda (which I use and highly recommend) just make sure these are installed, which can be done using the conda commands:

For CVXPY: 
`conda install -c conda-forge cvxpy`

For NumPy:
`conda install numpy`
